This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a .env.local file following the convention of .env.sample file to add your linkedIn credentials (or your company's or a temporarily made linkedIn). 

then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

OR to run a build (instead of development server):

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm run start
```
